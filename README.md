Basmati is a cli command like utility to stream archives up and down, to and from AWS Glacier, AWS's cold storage offering. Cold storage means that when you want your files you have to send in a request to be fulfilled within 6 - 12 hours. The process is pretty tiresome as you need to dowload your archive within a certain time frame of having initiated the download job. Basmati makes it easy by showing your inventory in a TUI application, polling Glacier until the job is ready and completed and calculating all the annoying treehashes to successfuly upload archives.

### Environment and setup

The tool assumes your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are in your environment already. There is currently no way to pass those in as command line arguments.

### Packaging

Basmati is currently available as a crate or as Nix flake

```
# crate
cargo install basmati
```

```nix
# get the flake
{
  inputs = {
    ...
    basmati.url = "github:vhsconnect/basmati";

};

```

```nix
# add to your packages attribute set
{pkgs, inputs, ...} :{
    environment.systemPackages = [
        inputs.basmati.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
    ]

};


```
